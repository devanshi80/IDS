# 🛡️ Smart Threat Detection

A real-time, ML-powered system to detect potentially malicious bot-related activity by scanning open network ports on your machine. Built with ensemble learning, SHAP explainability, and an interactive Streamlit UI.

---

## Project Overview

Smart Threat Detection is an intelligent threat monitoring tool that scans your local machine for open ports and classifies each port as **benign** or **bot-related** using a trained ensemble ML model. It combines insights from five popular classifiers using a soft-voting strategy and provides **transparent, explainable results** using SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations).

Built to demonstrate full-stack machine learning + system-level monitoring for Major League Hacking (MLH) Fellowship application.

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/SmartThreatDetection.git
cd SmartThreatDetection
pip install -r requirements.txt
````

---

## Run the Streamlit App (UI)

```bash
streamlit run streamlit_app.py
```

**Features:**

* Scan your system for open ports.
* View classification results and confidence scores.
* Understand predictions using SHAP waterfall plots.
* Upload a `.csv` file with ports for batch predictions.
* View and filter historical predictions from log file.

---

## Run via CLI

### Train the Model

```bash
python app.py --train
```

### Scan & Classify Ports

```bash
python app.py --scan
```

---

## Risk Score Logging

Every prediction is automatically logged to `risk_scores.csv` with:

* Timestamp
* Port number
* Prediction label (BENIGN / BOT)
* Probability score
* Risk level (Low, Medium, High, Critical)

---

## SHAP Explainability

Uses SHAP to visualize feature contributions for each prediction, increasing trust and transparency in the ensemble model.

* SHAP waterfall plots are displayed directly in the Streamlit app
* Great for interviews and interpretability


---

##  Dataset Used

* **CICIDS2017** – Friday-WorkingHours Morning subset
* Preprocessed and mapped: `BENIGN` = 0, others = 1 (bot-like)

---

## Dependencies

* `scikit-learn`
* `xgboost`
* `shap`
* `psutil`
* `pandas`, `numpy`
* `matplotlib`, `seaborn`
* `streamlit`

Install all with:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
